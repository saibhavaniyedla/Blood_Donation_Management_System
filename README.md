# Blood_Donation_Management_System
It is a web application where a user can be a donor or a patient. If you want to donate blood, you can register as a donor. Patients can request blood, and when a matching blood group is found, donors receive email notifications with the patientâ€™s details. Users can also search for donors and take a quiz to learn more about blood donation.
